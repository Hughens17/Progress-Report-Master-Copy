Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a basic website using HTML learning about different tags like bold italics and links. Links are the center of my project. I have also looked into CSS to style my website.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The website so far is pretty basic. It doesn't have any color yet or real formatting. Just Lorem Ipsum text in the body a few images and links to random youtube videos. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Its all good so far. HTML is relatively new but I find it more straightforward and less logic based than python. I still want to learn how to stlye my website in the way that I want it and do more with links to create traps and popups and things of that nature.
